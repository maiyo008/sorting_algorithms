## Learning Objectives
---
* At least four different sorting algorithms
* What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
* How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
* What is a stable sorting algorithm

## Tasks
---
### Task 0. Bubble Sort
* Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the [Bubble sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort) algorithm
	* Prototype: `void bubble_sort(int *array, size_t size);`
	* You’re expected to print the array after each time you swap two elements 
* Write in the file `0-O`, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Bubble sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:
	* in the best case
	* in the average case
	* in the worst case

### Task 1. Insertion Sort
* Write a function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the [Insertion sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort) algorithm
	* Prototype: `void insertion_sort_list(listint_t **list);`
	* You are not allowed to modify the integer `n` of a node. You have to swap the nodes themselves.
	* You’re expected to print the list after each time you swap two elements
* Write in the file `1-O`, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Insertion sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:
	* in the best case
	* in the average case
	* in the worst case
